# ACME Solutions

A project featuring a mock landing page for an imaginary TechOps solutions company, meticulously developed using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Purposefully excluding frameworks and packages, this project showcases the capabilities of raw web development. Delve into the code to witness the creation of a polished and fully functional website, exemplifying expertise in front-end development.
